# Sakai-Nuxt Starter

Welcome to the Sakai-Nuxt Starter template! This is a personal starter kit designed to help you kickstart your Nuxt.js projects with ease.

## Overview

The Sakai-Nuxt Starter is a port of the [Sakai Vue](https://github.com/primefaces/sakai-vue) template, tailored for Nuxt.js applications. It features a customized sidebar that replaces the default one, aiming to provide a more intuitive navigation experience.

**Note:** As this is a starter kit, it does not include certain configurations, such as the ability to change the color palette like the original Sakai Vue template. These features are planned for a more complete template currently under development.

## Features

- **Customized Sidebar:** A revamped sidebar for improved navigation.
- **Nuxt.js Integration:** Pre-configured with Nuxt.js to streamline your development process.
- **Starter Template:** Designed to be a foundation for your projects, allowing for easy customization and expansion.
